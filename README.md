data/stars_base.csv | A list of 451 stars. Names and spectral class are derived from the IAU database of named stars. Apart from the name and the "human readable" classification there is also luminosity (min, max), number of gas planets (min, max) and number of rock planets (min, max). It's more or less "physically accurate" with respect to usable gameplay.
